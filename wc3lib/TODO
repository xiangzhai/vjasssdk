* If removeFile is called with an instance of an MPQ file of the method's corresponding MPQ archive, it should be removed directly instead of searching it again.
* Check always the corresponding MPQ archive and throw exceptions if it's the same (e. g. if you want to add an MPQ file at twice).

2010-04-01 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Note that there can't be as many blocks in MPQ archives as int32 allows since last two numbers are reserved for empty and deleted blocks.
* Maybe we should drop block list and do only use map (since hash entries do use block indices)?

2010-03-29 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Add program man pages.
* Fix hash type for "(hash table)" and "(block table)" keys.

2010-03-25 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Some int8 (locales of hash entries and sectorSizeShift of MPQ header) values of the MPQ specification are defined as int16 values in StormLib and libmpq.
* Block index values of hash instances aren't correct (wrong decryption of hash table?).

2010-03-20 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Add MPQ file direct read- and writing capability.

2010-03-12 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Camera seems to be documentated wrongly (ordering of translations and rotation lengths).

2010-02-27 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* DONE: Use <boost/cstdint.hpp> instead of <stdint.h> since the second one is C99.

2010-02-15 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Revise classes map::Environment and map::Tilepoint (add class Tileset for tileset ids).

2010-01-28 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Add custom cmake modules for finding packages OGRE and openjpeg/jpeglib.
* Add man page.
* Write latex specification of Jass++
* Improve compiler suggestion of Jass++.
* Write latex specification of SimpleJass.

2010-01-23 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* New application tilesetter should allow user to modify tile data by changing data of each tilepoint of an user-defined w3e file.
	The tool is required since "Die Macht des Feuers" needs it for its first map (which has some corrupted tileset data).
	Command list: 
		* open
		* close
		* save
		* show <all|header|tilepoints| ...>
		* set <version|maintileset|customized|goundtilesetids|clifftilesetids|maxx|maxy|centeroffsetx|centeroffsety|waterlevel|flags|groundtexturetype|texturedetails|clifftexturetype|layerheight>

2010-01-22 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Compression mode should be choosable for newly created MpqFile instances!
* File block and hash data should be written into MPQ archive file when it's modified.
* Check out if it's possible to add new blocks and hashes to an MPQ archive (or fixed number). MPQ Editor says that hash table size is the maximum of files which can be added and it's fixed!

2010-01-15 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Apparently the StormLib loads the whole block and hash table into system memory .
* Decrypt the whole block table at once?!

2010-01-14 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Use std::streamsize (in case of need by conversion) for all byte returns of read methods.

2010-01-11 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Write methods should be const.
* Enable Boost threading exception handling (-fexceptions).
* Separate class instances in converter application.

2010-01-06 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Improve warblend python scripts (add light support, ambient values?).
* Each MDLX object which can have a parent object is able to define its own customized translation, rotation and scaling (see MDL format specification), otherwise it will be inherited???
* Editor should get path brush tool like W3ZMapEdit has.
* Editor terrain (tile point) editor should be much more advanced than in normal WE (flags and layer should be choosable).

2009-12-05 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Blp ignores 0 bytes but writes (paletted, alphas) exactly the same byte number.

2009-11-29 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Wc3C.net quote "the jpeg-blps are using IJL_OTHER color space".
* Add language files for FDF, SLK, MDL and various .txt UI files.

2009-11-25 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* DONE: Maybe rename Blp::Uncompressed to Blp::PalettedCompressed.
* DONE: Add constant member Blp::maxCompressedPaletteSize.
* Too much mip map data is read (end of file)?

2009-11-23 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* BLP2 uses another specification or BaerWeiss.blp is BlpUncompressed2, fix BlpUncompressed1 and BlpUncompressed2 diffences recognition.

2009-11-17 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* DEPRECATED (since they're using file paths): Use Boost libraries image classes to read and write images with the BLP library.
* Allow JPEG compression option.

2009-11-15 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Fix particle emitter 2's translation 1 reading, missing rotation tag for following rotations.

2009-11-14 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Class Blp should read JPEG mip maps by using Open JPEG.

2009-11-13 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Add class for MdxBlocks with nbytes followed by struct lists (like GroupMdxBlock).

2009-11-11 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Class Blp should always use format of BlpUncompressed1 and convert other formats when readed and written.
* Add Qt or KDE BLP image class.

2009-11-08 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Fix Ogre search in cmake files.
* DONE: How to use compile flags with make files?

2009-11-03 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Missing layer alphas.
* Add editor GUI widgets.

2009-11-01 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* MPQ files should be readed and create MpqFile instances for each file or use the native types of specification?
* Required compile flags: BLEND (supports Blender file conversion), DEBUG (cmake debug mode)

2009-10-28 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Use new classes GroupMdxBlock and GroupMdxBlockMember.
* Add new abstract classes for MDX blocks.
* Add exists checks to MDX write methods.

2009-10-15 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Check out which sub MDX tags (tags in tags) aren't optional.

2009-10-13 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Fix MDX property validation (+n means n or bigger than n, I think).

2009-10-09 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Use BLP header mip map offsets and sizes.
* Note that there is unused space between header and JPEG mip map data which probably can be removed.
* Read something about JPEG format implementation since BLP specification does not explain this.

2009-10-08 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* BLP file reading (JPEG compression) does still not work.

2009-10-07 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* DONE: Use std::fstream::read for binary files.

2009-10-05 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Boost tokenizer does not get { tokens?

2009-10-02 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* MDLX classes should get their corresponding list classes as start member (class Alpha needs class Alphas instead of class Mdlx).
* Little and big endian ....

2009-09-26 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Editor needs model and mpq editor.
