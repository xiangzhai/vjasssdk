* Apparently the StormLib loads the whole block and hash table into system memory .
* Decrypt the whole block table at once?!

2010-01-14 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Use std::streamsize (in case of need by conversion) for all byte returns of read methods.

2010-01-11 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Write methods should be const.
* Enable Boost threading exception handling (-fexceptions).
* Separate class instances in converter application.

2010-01-06 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Improve warblend python scripts (add light support, ambient values?).
* Each MDLX object which can have a parent object is able to define its own customized translation, rotation and scaling (see MDL format specification), otherwise it will be inherited???
* Editor should get path brush tool like W3ZMapEdit has.
* Editor terrain (tile point) editor should be much more advanced than in normal WE (flags and layer should be choosable).

2009-12-05 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Blp ignores 0 bytes but writes (paletted, alphas) exactly the same byte number.

2009-11-29 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Wc3C.net quote "the jpeg-blps are using IJL_OTHER color space".
* Add language files for FDF, SLK, MDL and various .txt UI files.

2009-11-25 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* DONE: Maybe rename Blp::Uncompressed to Blp::PalettedCompressed.
* DONE: Add constant member Blp::maxCompressedPaletteSize.
* Too much mip map data is read (end of file)?

2009-11-23 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* BLP2 uses another specification or BaerWeiss.blp is BlpUncompressed2, fix BlpUncompressed1 and BlpUncompressed2 diffences recognition.

2009-11-17 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* DEPRECATED (since they're using file paths): Use Boost libraries image classes to read and write images with the BLP library.
* Allow JPEG compression option.

2009-11-15 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Fix particle emitter 2's translation 1 reading, missing rotation tag for following rotations.

2009-11-14 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Class Blp should read JPEG mip maps by using Open JPEG.

2009-11-13 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Add class for MdxBlocks with nbytes followed by struct lists (like GroupMdxBlock).

2009-11-11 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Class Blp should always use format of BlpUncompressed1 and convert other formats when readed and written.
* Add Qt or KDE BLP image class.

2009-11-08 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Fix Ogre search in cmake files.
* DONE: How to use compile flags with make files?

2009-11-03 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Missing layer alphas.
* Add editor GUI widgets.

2009-11-01 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* MPQ files should be readed and create MpqFile instances for each file or use the native types of specification?
* Required compile flags: BLEND (supports Blender file conversion), DEBUG (cmake debug mode)

2009-10-28 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Use new classes GroupMdxBlock and GroupMdxBlockMember.
* Add new abstract classes for MDX blocks.
* Add exists checks to MDX write methods.

2009-10-15 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Check out which sub MDX tags (tags in tags) aren't optional.

2009-10-13 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Fix MDX property validation (+n means n or bigger than n, I think).

2009-10-09 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Use BLP header mip map offsets and sizes.
* Note that there is unused space between header and JPEG mip map data which probably can be removed.
* Read something about JPEG format implementation since BLP specification does not explain this.

2009-10-08 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* BLP file reading (JPEG compression) does still not work.

2009-10-07 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* DONE: Use std::fstream::read for binary files.

2009-10-05 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Boost tokenizer does not get { tokens?

2009-10-02 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* MDLX classes should get their corresponding list classes as start member (class Alpha needs class Alphas instead of class Mdlx).
* Little and big endian ....

2009-09-26 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Editor needs model and mpq editor.
