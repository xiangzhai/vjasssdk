2009-05-08 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Missing functions SetTerrainFogForPlayer and SetTerrainFogExForPlayer?

2009-04-09 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* AInventory: Unit orders for moving items aren't received.
* AInventory: Equipment is not placed in rucksack if you've already equip an item of the same equipment type.
* FIXED: AInventory: Attributes should always be the same (if you open your rucksack).
* AInventory: Change rucksack page items aren't usable.
* ACharacterScheme: Add a separator field between hit points and mana bar.
* ASpell: Cast actions will stop when user calls TriggerSleepAction().

2009-04-08 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Add member m_ prefix and rename get methods.
* Main window is not created correctly.

2009-04-05 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Add log functionality to talk system for AInfo instances.
* Fix revival timer function call.
* Fix talk trigger sleep function.
* Fix name display in character scheme.
* Maybe add preloadMusic() function since music loading often laggs in game.
* Quest pings should be displayed at the same time (maybe use only one ping trigger for all).

* Abstract quest id won't be attached correctly on its state trigger.
* First speech of talks will be displayed but the wait time will be ignored (Executions are right)!
* Rucksack page items can not be equipped.
* bj_MAX_PLAYERS an manchen Stellen durch eine Funktion ersetzen, die die maximale Spieleranzahl der jeweiligen Karte zurückgibt.
* Test the important talk speech and the normal talk speech (There are several problems with using TriggerSleepActions in action executions).
* Videos should be stopped immediatly (stop execution if it is possible).
* Character selection select action should be called (probably it is causing many bugs).
* InsertLineBreaks is bugged! When it is debugged use it in Gui.showInfoDialog()!
* Since there is gexxo's FirstOfGroupSave() function you have to replace all FirstOfGroup() calls which are used on groups which contain units which can be removed during the game.
* Rename all model files into English.
* Check size member of AContainer struct.
* FIXED: Missing many grassland model files?!

Notes:
* When you use a talk button, the action of the button won't be runned and it does not wait for finishing the transmission.
* The save bug (Undefined type nothinng) was caused by the fpscommon.j.
* Man muss jedes Mal MultiboardGetItem erneut aufrufen, dann etwas ändern (Es gehen auch mehrere Dinge) und dann MultiboardReleaseItem aufrufen.
* The TriggerSleepAction function does not work in executions. That's the reason for some bugs in ATalk and AVideo.
* Der Video wurde automatisch übersprungen, da die Bedingung dem Auslöser nicht hinzugefügt wurde.
* %s or something similar could crash Warcraft if you placed it in the custom script section.
* Methods are often called by TriggerEvaluate:
Methods are different to normal functions in that they can be called from any place (except global declarations)
and that you are not necessarily able to use waits, sync natives or GetTriggeringTrigger() inside them
(but you may use any other event response), you might be able to use them but it depends on various factors,
it is not recommended to use them at all. In next versions the compiler might even raise a syntax error when
it finds them.
I should probably extend stuff, if you call a method from above its declaration,
it is called with TriggerEvaluate, also if you make a method virtual
(that is, the method comes from an interface or is a stub method)
