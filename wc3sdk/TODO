* Add computer controller and shared control support to character system.

2009-08-24 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* FIXED: If you move an item to next page second time, next page item is moved sometimes?!

2009-08-08 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* DONE: Replace struct type vectors by AIntegerVector.
* FIXED: Vector structs need more space.
* FIXED: If an item is equipped while the rucksack is opened, abilities should be added to character and abilities of the unequipping item should be removed.
* If an item is unequipped for another one and item requirements are checked, items can be moved to rucksack though the new equipped item fits all requirements.
* FIXED: Resetting equipped items which where switched diagonal does not work.
* FIXED: Missing item name in "Add to rucksack." message.

2009-08-07 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* init methods of structs AThirdPersonCamera and AArrowKeys should have their constant settings as parameters.

2009-08-05 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* DONE: Fix custom system enabl- and disabling.

2009-07-31 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* DONE: Fix camera height of talk camera.

2009-07-23 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Note: Do not destroy triggers in their own actions if there are some TriggerSleepAction calls after destruction.

2009-07-18 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Native declarations in map file don't work.

2009-07-11 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Maybe we should use function UnitDropItemSlot instead of all those item removals in the inventory system.

2009-07-07 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Perhaps you should add various characters schema pages/views like statistics (deaths, kills etc.).
* Add button models for system debugger (by using Blender).

2009-06-21 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Note: Never create add conditions or actions to a trigger which are defined as static methods below the trigger creation.

2009-06-05 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Not necessary: Implement a vector for player characters.
* DONE: Finish function CopyUnit.
* DONE: Finish ATalk and AInfo revision.

2009-05-25 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* FIXED: Revival timer does only appear when the character dies with "Reincarnation".
* Note: Don't make a character unmovable when he dies since this will disable all systems (like revival). Specify everything for each single system!

2009-05-22 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* DONE: We need lists like in C++ for structs like ALightningChain!

2009-05-21 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* FIXED: File "archives/Creatures/Models/Creatures/Undeads/Zombie.mdx" doesn't work?!

2009-05-11 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Added static method channelCondition to struct ASpell.

2009-05-08 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Missing functions SetTerrainFogForPlayer and SetTerrainFogExForPlayer?

2009-04-09 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* FIXED: AInventory: Unit orders for moving items aren't received.
* FIXED: AInventory: Equipment is not placed in rucksack if you've already equipped an item of the same equipment type.
* FIXED: AInventory: Attributes should always be the same (if you open your rucksack).
* FIXED: AInventory: Change rucksack page items aren't usable.
* DONE: ACharacterScheme: Add a separator field between hit points and mana bar.
* FIXED: ASpell: Cast actions will stop when user calls TriggerSleepAction().

2009-04-08 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Add member m_ prefix and rename get methods.
* FIXED: Main window is not created correctly.

2009-04-05 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* Add log functionality to talk system for AInfo instances.
* DONE: Fix revival timer function call.
* DONE: Fix talk trigger sleep function.
* DONE: Fix name display in character scheme.
* Maybe add preloadMusic() function since music loading often laggs in game.
* DONE: Quest pings should be displayed at the same time (maybe use only one ping trigger for all).

Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de>
* FIXED: Abstract quest id won't be attached correctly on its state trigger.
* FIXED: First speech of talks will be displayed but the wait time will be ignored (Executions are right)!
* FIXED: Rucksack page items can not be equipped.
* bj_MAX_PLAYERS an manchen Stellen durch eine Funktion ersetzen, die die maximale Spieleranzahl der jeweiligen Karte zurückgibt.
* FIXED: Test the important talk speech and the normal talk speech (There are several problems with using TriggerSleepActions in action executions).
* FIXED: Videos should be stopped immediatly (stop execution if it is possible).
* Character selection select action should be called (probably it is causing many bugs).
* InsertLineBreaks is bugged! When it is debugged use it in Gui.showInfoDialog()!
* Since there is gexxo's FirstOfGroupSave() function you have to replace all FirstOfGroup() calls which are used on groups which contain units which can be removed during the game.
* Rename all model files into English.
* DONE: Check size member of AContainer struct.
* FIXED: Missing many grassland model files?!

Notes:
* When you use a talk button, the action of the button won't be runned and it does not wait for finishing the transmission.
* The save bug (Undefined type nothinng) was caused by the fpscommon.j.
* Man muss jedes Mal MultiboardGetItem erneut aufrufen, dann etwas ändern (Es gehen auch mehrere Dinge) und dann MultiboardReleaseItem aufrufen.
* The TriggerSleepAction function does not work in executions. That's the reason for some bugs in ATalk and AVideo.
* Der Video wurde automatisch übersprungen, da die Bedingung dem Auslöser nicht hinzugefügt wurde.
* %s or something similar could crash Warcraft if you placed it in the custom script section.
* Methods are often called by TriggerEvaluate:
Methods are different to normal functions in that they can be called from any place (except global declarations)
and that you are not necessarily able to use waits, sync natives or GetTriggeringTrigger() inside them
(but you may use any other event response), you might be able to use them but it depends on various factors,
it is not recommended to use them at all. In next versions the compiler might even raise a syntax error when
it finds them.
I should probably extend stuff, if you call a method from above its declaration,
it is called with TriggerEvaluate, also if you make a method virtual
(that is, the method comes from an interface or is a stub method)
