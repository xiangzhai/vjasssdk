Parts of current script version are not stable yet!

This is the Jass and vJass script part of the vjasssdk
consisting of many useful code files.
It's called "Advanced Script Library" or just ASL.
It contains some useful systems which can be used for creating your own cool Warcraft 3 TFT map or project.
Help me to find bugs and give me suggestions on http://sourceforge.net/projects/vjasssdk or by e-mail:

I moved the scripts into extern code files since I'm working on a Linux system and the trigger
editor is very bugged if you use it by wine. Additionally some files can be excluded easily
which decreases map file size.
Use file "src/Import Asl.j" to import all required scripts.
Usually you have to change the lookup folder entry in the "jasshelper.conf" file of your JassHelper
program before.
The JassHelper has to lookup folder "src" in this directory.
If you're using a huge amount of code (like me) I recommend dropping "pjass" usage and replacing it
by JassParser (http://www.wc3c.net/showthread.php?t=105235) since there is a memory exhausted bug in
"pjass".
ASL supports "japi" and "RtC". Just set A_JAPI or A_RTC true.
If you set A_FPS_MOVEMENT true (which needs A_RTC set to be true, too) the character movement system
should be usable by mouse keys.
For using the object data (e. g. BonusMod) you have to make an entry in the "jasshelper.conf" file for
the object merger tool.
It should always be named "ObjectMerger".
Note that many parts of the ASL are not finished yet.
