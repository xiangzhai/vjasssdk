Current script version is not stable yet!

This is the Jass and vJass script part of the vjasssdk
consisting of many useful files.
It's called "Advanced Script Library" or ASL.
It contains some useful systems which can be used for creating your own cool project.
Help me to find bugs and give me suggestions on http://www.inwarcraft.de/ or by e-mail:

I moved the scripts into extern text files because I'm working on a Linux system and the trigger
editor is very bugged if you use it by wine.
Use the "Import Asl.j" file to import the scripts.
Usually you have to change the lookup folder entry in the "jasshelper.conf" file of your JassHelper
program before.
The JassHelper has to lookup this folder.
Aside from you have to use the fpscommon.j file since the ASL is able to support the FPS mod
(http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/f567/).
For using the object data you have to make an entry in the "jasshelper.conf" file for
the object merger tool.
It should be named OBJMERGE.
Note that many parts of the ASL are not finished yet.
