wc3sdk (formerly called "vjasssdk") is a collection of useful tools which do support working more efficient with Blizzard's specified formats for their game Warcraft 3 and its add-on Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne.
Some parts has been developed by Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu> (me) who is main contributor and creator of wc3sdk. Others has been improved or changed by him but originally were developed by others.
Usually most applications should be able to be run on UNIX, Win32 and Mac OS platforms.
This is a list of all provided directories with tools, projects and documentation and their brief descriptions:

* book:
	German book about Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne modification including custom format specifications such as JASS++.

* doc:
	This directory contains many documentation files for various Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne related formats.

* JassHelper:
	JassHelper is a vJass and Zinc parser and "to-Jass-compiler" written in Pascal by Vexorian.
	It allows you to parse vJass and Zinc code files and check them for syntax errors. Afterwards it generates a JASS map script.
	This program has not been changed yet in "wc3sdk". Initially it has been added to fix some bugs and to make it cross-platform.

* katevjasside:
	Before project wc3lib was launched I had tried to create an add-on for KDE's well-known editor Kate.
	Unfortunately it hadn't been appeared correctly on my custom system and therefore I stopped development quickly.

* mpqeditor:
	mpqeditor is a little project which was being launched to create a KDE-integrated MPQ editor which uses StormLib for MPQ file access.
	At the moment it is not being developed anymore since there is the wc3lib project now.

* pjass:
	PJass is a JASS parser/syntax validator written in C by Rudi Cilibrasi. It is able to parse JASS code and check it for syntax errors.
	This program has got cmake and gettext support in "wc3sdk".

* syntax highlightings:
	There are two supported editors: Kate and Notepad++. Note that Zinc highlighting is still missing and MDL and JASS++ highlightings are still in beta stage.

* vjassdoc:
	vjassdoc is an API documentation generating tool which generates an API documentation by parsing JASS and/or vJass code files.
	The generated documentation offers simple HTML files which list all parsed and specified objects of the code.
	Additionally it allows users to generate an SQLite3 database for external usage.
	It is clearly written in C++ code using the STDL, C++ Boost Libraries, gettext and SQLite3 C API.
	Consider the development of this project has also been stopped since there's the new project "wc3lib" now which will use Bison and Flex to analyse a language's syntax. However, this tool should still be fully usable for most JASS and vJass code.

* vjasside
	vjasside is an IDE (integrated development environment) using Nokia's C++ framework Qt and which is written in C++.
	It helps you to handle your JASS and vJass code. Besides it integrates most of other tools provided by "wc3sdk", so you do not have to use every tool as stand-alone application.
	Note that the development of this project has also been stopped since there are more efficient ways (e. g. KDE) to provide a JASS, vJass and Zinc IDE.
	It's not usable for end users at its current stage.

* vjasstrans:
	vjasstrans is an internationalisation tool for JASS code and Warcraft 3 related projects (similary to gettext).
	It's able to parse JASS code, WTS and FDF files for their content and it can also replace
	or append it. It's very useful if you want to replace some strings in your code by id strings
	and add them to the WTS file ("war3map.wts") of your map to provide your map in different languages.
	Meanwhile, it has been moved to project "wc3lib".

* wc3lib:
	wc3lib is a format library which allows you to read and write Blizzard's formats designed for the game Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne:
	* BLP
	* MDL
	* MDX
	* MPQ
	* W3N
	* W3M
	* W3X
	* W3G
	* etc.
	Additionally it provides some tools and support for some non-Blizzard formats like vJass.
	It's the current main project of "wc3sdk". It may provide an editor emulation someday.

* ASL (wc3sdk - src):
	ASL (Advanced Script Library) is a code library written in vJass which provides the core functionality for the German Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne modification "Die Macht des Feuers".

* archives (wc3sdk - archives):
	Collection of models and textures which can be used in Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne. Also used in "Die Macht des Feuers".
