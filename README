The vjasssdk is a collection of useful tools which help you working more efficient with Blizzard's Warcraft 3 specific formats.
Some parts has been developed by Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.de> and others were made up by him but developed by others.
Most applications should usually be able to be run on UNIX, Win32 and Mac OS platforms.
Here is a list of all provided tools and their brief descriptions:

* vjasside
	The vjasside is an integrated development GUI environment written in Trolltechs (by now Nokia) C++ framework Qt.
	It helps to handle your Jass and vJass code. Besides it integrates most of the other tools,
	so you do not have to use every tool as stand-alone application.
	Note that the development of this project has stopped since there are more efficient ways (e. g. KDE 4) to provide
	a Jass, vJass and Zinc IDE.

* vjassdoc:
	vjassdoc is an API documentation tool which generates an API documentation by parsing your Jass and vJass files.
	The documentation offers simple HTML files which list all parsed objects of the code which are necessary for other devlopers.
	Additionally it allows the user to generate a SQLite3 database for extern programs.
	It is clearly written in C++ code using the STDL, C++ Boost Libraries, gettext and SQLite3.

* PJass:
	PJass is a Jass parser written in C by Rudi Cilibrasi. It is able to parse Jass code files and check them for syntax errors.

* JassHelper:
	The JassHelper is a vJass and Zinc parser and "to-Jass-compiler" written in Pascal by Vexorian.
	It allows you to parse vJass and Zinc code files and check them for syntax errors. Afterwards it generates a Jass map script.

* Syntax highlighting files:
	There are two supported editors: Kate and Notepad++. Note that Zinc highlighting is still missing.

* Languages:
	At the moment there are some language files which are Lex and Yacc files for the scripting languages Jass, vJass and Zinc.
	These language files will be used for newly generated parser and compiler for those languages. They're also intended for replacing
	vjassdoc's customized parser.

* wc3lib
	wc3lib is a Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne format library which allows you to read and write Blizzard's formats:
	* BLP
	* MDL
	* MDX
	* MPQ
	* W3N
	* W3M
	* W3X
	* W3G
	* etc.
