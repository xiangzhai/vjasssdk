The vjasssdk is a collection of useful tools which help working more efficient with Blizzard's Warcraft 3 scripting
language Jass and its extension vJass.
It has been assembled by Barad√© and usually runs on UNIX, Win32 and Mac OS platforms.
Here you can see a list of all provided tools and their description:
- vjasside
	The vjasside is an integrated development GUI environment written in Trolltechs C++ framework Qt.
	It makes you easier to handle your code and your projects. Also it integrates all of the other tools,
	so you do not have to use every tool as stand-alone application.

- vjassdoc:
	vjassdoc is an API documentation tool which generates an API documentation by parsing your Jass and vJass files.
	The documentation can be a simple HTML file which lists all of the code which is nessacary for other devlopers who
	want to use it or/and a SQLite3 database for extern programs.
	It is clearly written in C++ code using the STDL, gettext and SQLite3.

- PJass:
	PJass is a Jass parser written in C by Rudi Cilibrasi. It is able to parse Jass code files and check them for syntax errors.

- JassHelper:
	The JassHelper is a vJass parser written in Pascal by Vexorian. It is able to parse vJass code files and check them for syntax
	errors. Afterwards it generates a Jass map script and adds it to a map file.
