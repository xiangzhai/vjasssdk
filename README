vjasssdk is a collection of useful tools which do support working more efficient with Blizzard's specified formats for their game Warcraft 3 and its add-on Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne.
Some parts has been developed by Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu> (me) who is main contributor and creator of vjasssdk. Others has been improved or changed by him but originally were developed by others.
Most applications should usually be able being run on UNIX, Win32 and Mac OS platforms.
Here is a list of all provided directories with tools, projects and documentation and their brief descriptions:

* doc:
	This directory contains many documentation files for various Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne related formats and also some specifications for custom formats like Jass++.
	Additionally it contains first documents for the German book "Warcraft-3-The-Frozen-Throne-Modifikation" which hopefully will become some bigger and contain lots of information about all stuff around modification of Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne.

* JassHelper:
	JassHelper is a vJass and Zinc parser and "to-Jass-compiler" written in Pascal by Vexorian.
	It allows you to parse vJass and Zinc code files and check them for syntax errors. Afterwards it generates a Jass map script.
	This program has not been changed yet in vjasssdk. Initially it has been added to fix some bugs and make it cross-platform.

* katevjasside:
	Before project wc3lib was being started I had tried to create an add-on for KDE's well-known editor Kate.
	Unfortunately it didn't appear correctly on my custom system and therefore I had stopped development quickly.

* mpqeditor:
	mpqeditor is a little project which has been started to create a KDE-integrated MPQ editor which uses StormLib for MPQ file access.
	At the moment it is not being developed since there is the wc3lib project now.

* PJass:
	PJass is a Jass parser written in C by Rudi Cilibrasi. It is able to parse Jass code files and check them for syntax errors.
	This program has got cmake and gettext support in vjasssdk.

* Syntax highlightings:
	There are two supported editors: Kate and Notepad++. Note that Zinc highlighting is still missing and MDL highlighting is still in beta stage.

* vjassdoc:
	vjassdoc is an API documentation tool which generates an API documentation by parsing Jass and vJass code files.
	The documentation offers simple HTML files which list all parsed and specified objects of the code.
	Additionally it allows users to generate an SQLite3 database for extern programs.
	It is clearly written in C++ code using the STDL, C++ Boost Libraries, gettext and SQLite3 C API.
	Note that the development of this project has also been stopped since there's the new project wc3lib now which will use Bison and Flex to analyse a language's syntax. However, this tool should be fully usable for most Jass and vJass code.

* vjasside
	vjasside is an IDE (integrated development environment) using Trolltech's (by now Nokia's) C++ framework Qt and written in C++.
	It helps to handle your Jass and vJass code. Besides it integrates most of other tools provided by vjasssdk, so you do not have to use every tool as stand-alone application.
	Note that the development of this project has been stopped since there are more efficient ways (e. g. KDE) to provide a Jass, vJass and Zinc IDE.
	It's not usable for end users at its current stage.

vjasstrans:
	vjasstrans is an internationalisation tool for Jass code and Warcraft 3 related projects.
	It's able to parse Jass code, WTS and FDF files for their content and it can also replace
	or append it. It's very useful if you want to replace some strings in your code by id strings
	and add them to the WTS file (war3map.wts) of your map to provide your map in different languages.

* wc3lib:
	wc3lib is a format library which allows you to read and write Blizzard's formats designed for the game Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne:
	* BLP
	* MDL
	* MDX
	* MPQ
	* W3N
	* W3M
	* W3X
	* W3G
	* etc.
	Additionally it provides some tools and support for some non-Blizzard formats like vJass.
	At the moment it is being developed heavily and fast but since there is a lot of work to do it will probably take a long time until it becomes really usable.

* wc3sdk:
	wc3sdk firstly provides the ASL (advanced script library) and secondly some big archives with Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne modifcation files like models, textures etc.
	Actually vjasssdk should be called wc3sdk since it's not really just related to vJass but wc3sdk has been started before.
