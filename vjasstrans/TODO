* Add option --iwts for including read wts files (if included file contains a translation it will be used, this option cannot be used with --fill).
* Add option --ifdf for including read fdf files (if included file contains a translation it will be used, this option cannot be used with --fill).
* DONE: Add option --startatlast which allows user to start with string id bigger than the biggest one in the appended file and to do not use free ids between range 0 and biggest used string id.
* DONE: Save strings in map sorted by id which increases access and search time.

* Use opt_get and boost libraries instead of POSIX.

* Reading fdf files does not work correctly since { character seems to be ignored by boost tokenizer -.-.
* Check string conflict search.

* Improved file parsing (check the validity "syntax" of wts and fdf files).
* Use exceptions instead of return values.
* If you want to ignore function calls in comment definitions it should be choosable which scripting language the parsed file has since vJass adds block comments to syntax.

* ADDED: Add read functionality of fdf files.
* Function calls after comment definitions should be ignored.
